abstract = {This book covers modern approaches to Verification and Validation of computer codes and other topics related to the Quantification of Uncertainty and code Quality Assurance. Especially noteworthy are the Method of Manufactured Solutions, a general method for obtaining exact solutions for code Verifications, and the Grid Convergence Index, a method for uniform reporting of grid convergence tests. Applicable to commercial codes and to all problems modeled by partial differential equations, examples include CFD, Groundwater Modeling, etc. Provides useable formulas and practical guidance for error estimation and experimental Validation.},

abstract = {The problem of numerically integrating general elliptic differential equations in irregular two and three dimensional regions is discussed. The method used numerically computes a transformation of the given region into a rectangular region. The numerical coordinate transformation is determined by requiring that the components of the transformation satisfy inhomogeneous Laplace or more general equations. The transformation is then used to transform the differential equation and the boundary conditions to the rectangular region. The boundary value problem in the rectangular region is integrated using one of the standard methods for general elliptic equations. The use of the existing software reduces the problem to analytically transforming the given differential equation and the Laplacian to general coordinate frame and then writing subroutines that will tabulate the coefficients of these differential equations using the tabulated coordinate transformation. This method has been successfully used in two dimensions so we are concerned with the three dimensional extension of the existing codes where the major problem encountered is the volume of algebra and coding required to complete the method. To overcome these difficulties, a symbol manipulation program in VAXIMA is written that has as input the formula for the given differential equation in some natural coordinates and has as output the required FORTRAN subroutines. Because of the complexity of the resulting code, code validation was performed by systematic truncation error testing. The paper concludes with a discussion of the problems encountered in using a symbol manipulator to write large FORTRAN codes. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

@article{Roache2002,
abstract = {Verification of Calculations involves error estimation, whereas Verification of Codes involves error evaluation, from known benchmark solutions. The best benchmarks are exact analytical solutions with sufficiently complex solution structure; they need not be realistic since Verification is a purely mathematical exercise. The Method of Manufactured Solutions ({\{}MMS{\}}) provides a straightforward and quite general procedure for generating such solutions. For complex codes, the method utilizes Symbolic Manipulation, but here it is illustrated with simple examples. When used with systematic grid refinement studies, which are remarkably sensitive, {\{}MMS{\}} produces strong Code Verifications with a theorem-like quality and a clearly defined completion point.},
