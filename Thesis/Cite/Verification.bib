abstract = {Verification of Calculations involves error estimation, whereas Verification of Codes involves error evaluation, from known benchmark solutions. The best benchmarks are exact analytical solutions with sufficiently complex solution structure; they need not be realistic since Verification is a purely mathematical exercise. The Method of Manufactured Solutions ({\{}MMS{\}}) provides a straightforward and quite general procedure for generating such solutions. For complex codes, the method utilizes Symbolic Manipulation, but here it is illustrated with simple examples. When used with systematic grid refinement studies, which are remarkably sensitive, {\{}MMS{\}} produces strong Code Verifications with a theorem-like quality and a clearly defined completion point.},

@book{Roache,
abstract = {This book covers modern approaches to Verification and Validation of computer codes and other topics related to the Quantification of Uncertainty and code Quality Assurance. Especially noteworthy are the Method of Manufactured Solutions, a general method for obtaining exact solutions for code Verifications, and the Grid Convergence Index, a method for uniform reporting of grid convergence tests. Applicable to commercial codes and to all problems modeled by partial differential equations, examples include CFD, Groundwater Modeling, etc. Provides useable formulas and practical guidance for error estimation and experimental Validation.},
