abstract = {We describe a setting of a nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problem and the corresponding solution process in the finite element software package deal.II. The fluid equations are transformed via the ALE mapping (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian framework) to a reference configuration and these are coupled with the structure equations by a monolithic solution algorithm. To construct the ALE mapping, we use a biharmonic equation. Finite differences are used for tempo-ral discretization. The derivation is realized in a general manner that serves for different time stepping schemes. Spatial discretization is based on a Galerkin finite element scheme. The nonlinear system is solved by a Newton method. Us-ing this approach, the Jacobian matrix is constructed by exact computation of the directional derivatives. The implementation using the software library pack-age deal.II serves for the computation of different fluid-structure configurations. Specifically, our geometry data are taken from the fluid-structure benchmark configuration that was proposed in 2006 in the DFG project Fluid-Structure In-teraction I: Modelling, Simulation, Optimisation. Our results show that this implementation using deal.II is able to produce comparable findings.},

@article{Richter2010c,
abstract = {In this work we describe and compare two monolithic models for fluid-structure interaction problems: First, the well-established ALE model using natural Lagrangian coordinates for the structural model and using an artificial coordinate system for the flow problem. Then, a novel approach, the fully Eulerian coordinates, where both subproblems, structure and fluid are given in Eulerian coordinates. The approaches have in common that a closed variational formulation exists. This allows the use of implicit solution schemes, goal oriented error estimation and gradient based optimization algorithms.Aim of this work is the introduction and verification of the novel fully Eulerian model for stationary fluid-structure interaction problems. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Frei2016a,
abstract = {In this work, we develop numerical schemes for mechano-chemical fluid-structure interactions with long-term effects. We investigate a model of a growing solid interacting with an incompressible fluid. A typical example for such a situation is the formation and growth of plaque in blood vessels. This application includes two particular difficulties: First, growth may lead to very large deformations, up to full clogging of the fluid domain. We derive a simplified set of equations including a fluid-structure interaction system coupled to an ODE model for plaque growth in Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) coordinates and in Eulerian coordinates. The latter novel technique is capable of handling very large deformations up to contact. The second difficulty stems from the different time scales: while the dynamics of the fluid demand to resolve a scale of seconds, growth typically takes place in a range of months. We propose a temporal two-scale approach using local small-scale problems to compute an effective wall stress that will enter a long-scale problem. Our proposed techniques are substantiated with several numerical tests that include comparisons of the Eulerian and ALE approaches as well as convergence studies.},
