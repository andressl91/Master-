abstract = {In this work we describe and compare two monolithic models for fluid-structure interaction problems: First, the well-established ALE model using natural Lagrangian coordinates for the structural model and using an artificial coordinate system for the flow problem. Then, a novel approach, the fully Eulerian coordinates, where both subproblems, structure and fluid are given in Eulerian coordinates. The approaches have in common that a closed variational formulation exists. This allows the use of implicit solution schemes, goal oriented error estimation and gradient based optimization algorithms.Aim of this work is the introduction and verification of the novel fully Eulerian model for stationary fluid-structure interaction problems. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Fernandez2009,
abstract = {Fluid-structure coupled problems and their analysis have been addressed in the previous chapters (particularly in Chapter 3 and Chapter 8). In this chap-ter, we present some computational issues encountered in the resolution of these problems and propose efficient algorithms to solve them. A fluid-structure problem is defined by the fluid equations, the structure equations and by the transmission conditions at the fluid-structure inter-face $\Gamma$ (t): u f = u s , (9.1) $\sigma$ f {\textperiodcentered} n f + $\sigma$ s {\textperiodcentered} n s = 0. (9.2) We will show in Section 9.1 that these conditions are the key ingredients when deriving the energy equality of the continuous fluid-structure system. After discretization, a straightforward way to satisfy the discrete counterpart of (9.1) and (9.2) is to simultaneously solve the fluid and the structure prob-lems in a unique solver. This approach is usually referred to as a monolithic method. When relations (9.1) and (9.2) are satisfied after time discretization, one says that the method is strongly coupled. A monolithic method is typically strongly coupled and, hopefully, is stable in the energy norm. However, this approach needs ad hoc software development and results in a global solver which is less modular than two distinct fluid and structure solvers. In partic-ular it is difficult to devise efficient global preconditioners, and to maintain state-of-the-art schemes in each solver. With the so-called partitioned proce-dures (sometimes called segregated), the fluid and the structure are solved with their own software. This increases the capabilities of evolution and optimiza-tion of each code. Among the partitioned schemes, we have to distinguish the weakly coupled ones from the strongly coupled. A scheme is said to be weakly (or loosely or explicit) coupled when (9.1) and (9.2) are not exactly satisfied at each time step, or in other words, when a spurious numerical power may appear on the fluid-structure interface. Let us emphasise that a partitioned scheme is not necessarily weakly coupled: when sub-iterations are performed at each time step, the transmission conditions (9.1) and (9.2) can be enforced},

abstract = {We describe a setting of a nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problem and the corresponding solution process in the finite element software package deal.II. The fluid equations are transformed via the ALE mapping (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian framework) to a reference configuration and these are coupled with the structure equations by a monolithic solution algorithm. To construct the ALE mapping, we use a biharmonic equation. Finite differences are used for tempo-ral discretization. The derivation is realized in a general manner that serves for different time stepping schemes. Spatial discretization is based on a Galerkin finite element scheme. The nonlinear system is solved by a Newton method. Us-ing this approach, the Jacobian matrix is constructed by exact computation of the directional derivatives. The implementation using the software library pack-age deal.II serves for the computation of different fluid-structure configurations. Specifically, our geometry data are taken from the fluid-structure benchmark configuration that was proposed in 2006 in the DFG project Fluid-Structure In-teraction I: Modelling, Simulation, Optimisation. Our results show that this implementation using deal.II is able to produce comparable findings.},

abstract = {In this work, we develop numerical schemes for mechano-chemical fluid-structure interactions with long-term effects. We investigate a model of a growing solid interacting with an incompressible fluid. A typical example for such a situation is the formation and growth of plaque in blood vessels. This application includes two particular difficulties: First, growth may lead to very large deformations, up to full clogging of the fluid domain. We derive a simplified set of equations including a fluid-structure interaction system coupled to an ODE model for plaque growth in Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) coordinates and in Eulerian coordinates. The latter novel technique is capable of handling very large deformations up to contact. The second difficulty stems from the different time scales: while the dynamics of the fluid demand to resolve a scale of seconds, growth typically takes place in a range of months. We propose a temporal two-scale approach using local small-scale problems to compute an effective wall stress that will enter a long-scale problem. Our proposed techniques are substantiated with several numerical tests that include comparisons of the Eulerian and ALE approaches as well as convergence studies.},

The mesh movement is realized by solving an additional partial differential equation of harmonic, linear-elastic, or biharmonic type. We examine an implementation of time discretization that is designed with finite differences. Spatial discretization is based on a Galerkin finite element method. To solve the resulting discrete nonlinear systems, a Newton method with exact Jacobian matrix is used.

abstract = {In computation of fluid-structure interactions, we use mesh update methods consisting of mesh-moving and remeshing-as-needed. When the geometries are complex and the struc- tural displacements are large, it becomes even more important that the mesh moving techniques are designed with the objective to reduce the frequency of remeshing. To that end, we present here mesh moving techniques where the motion of the nodes is governed by the equations of elasticity, with selective treatment of mesh deformation based on element sizes as well as deformation modes in terms of shape and volume changes. We also present results from application of these techniques to a set of two-dimensional test cases. ?DOI:},
