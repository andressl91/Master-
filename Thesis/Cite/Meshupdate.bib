abstract = {In computation of fluid-structure interactions, we use mesh update methods consisting of mesh-moving and remeshing-as-needed. When the geometries are complex and the struc-tural displacements are large, it becomes even more important that the mesh moving techniques are designed with the objective to reduce the frequency of remeshing. To that end, we present here mesh moving techniques where the motion of the nodes is governed by the equations of elasticity, with selective treatment of mesh deformation based on element sizes as well as deformation modes in terms of shape and volume changes. We also present results from application of these techniques to a set of two-dimensional test cases.},

abstract = {Mesh deformation in response to redefined or moving aerodynamic surface geometries is a frequently encountered task in many applications. Most existing methods are either mathematically too complex or computationally too expensive for usage in practical design and optimization. We propose a simplified mesh deformation method based on linear elastic finite element analyses that can be easily implemented by using commercially available structural analysis software. Using a prescribed displacement at the mesh boundaries, a simple structural analysis is constructed based on a spatially varying Young's modulus to move the entire mesh in accordance with the surface geometry redefinitions. A variety of surface movements, such as translation, rotation, or incremental surface reshaping that often takes place in an optimization procedure, may be handled by the present method. We describe the numerical formulation and implementation using the NASTRAN software in this paper. The use of commercial software bypasses tedious reimplementation and takes advantage of the computational efficiency offered by the vendor. A two-dimensional airfoil mesh and a three-dimensional aircraft mesh were used as test cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Euler and Navier-Stokes calculations were performed for the deformed two-dimensional meshes.},

@article{Jasak2006,
abstract = {The moving-mesh unstructured Finite Volume Method (FVM) provides a capability of tackling flow simulations where the domain shape changes during the simulation. In such cases, the computational mesh needs to adapt to the time-varying shape of the domain and preserve its validity and quality. In this paper, we present a vertex-based unstructured mesh motion solver with the polyhedral cell support which calculates the internal point motion based on the prescribed motion of the boundary. The performance of the method is preserved through the choice of decomposition of polyhedral cells, the bounded discretisation and the use of iterative solvers. A mechanism for minimising mesh distortion through variable stiffness is proposed and tested on a simple deformation case, showing a marked improvement on previous attempts. Finally, the moving mesh solver is used with an unstructured moving mesh FVM algorithm to simulate a free-rising air bubble in water.},
