abstract = {We address the numerical simulation of fluid-structure systems involving an incompressible viscous fluid. This issue is particularly difficult to face when the fluid added-mass acting on the structure is strong, as it happens in hemodynamics for example. Indeed, several works have shown that, in such situations, implicit coupling seems to be necessary in order to avoid numerical instabilities. Although significant improvements have been achieved during the last years, solving implicit coupling often exhibits a prohibitive computational cost. In this work, we introduce a semi-implicit coupling scheme which remains stable for a reasonable range of the discretization parameters. The first idea consists in treating implicitly the added-mass effect, whereas the other contributions (geometrical non-linearities, viscous and convective effects) are treated explicitly. The second idea, relies on the fact that this kind of explicit-implicit splitting can be naturally performed using a Chorin-Temam projection scheme in the fluid. We prove (conditional) stability of the scheme for a fully discrete formulation. Several numerical experiments point out the efficiency of the present scheme compared to several implicit approaches.

@article{Gatzhammer2014,
abstract = {Computer simulations of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) phenomena have become an established branch of numerical simulation, with a wide range of applications in engineering, natural, and life sciences. Due to the integration of additional disciplines such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, or the inclusion of new physical fields such as acoustics or thermodynamics, the complexity of such simulations is constantly increasing. The partitioned approach to FSI, a domain decomposition technique, can be used to reduce this complexity. It allows to couple existing and mature flow and structure solvers by a third unit which gathers and provides all coupling related functionality. A trusted set of algorithms exists for standard problems, while more sophisticated FSI scenarios, particularly those involving incompress- ible flows, are still regarded as challenging. For those problems more efficient algorithms have been developed recently and are still to be spread among the community. An important observation is that most groups are still developing their own set of application-specific coupling functionality, despite the obvious possibility to reuse existing coupling codes. This work tries to improve that situation by developing and implement- ing a coupling library that uses validated state of the art algorithms for partitioned FSI. The library is designed to be generic from scratch, treating solvers as black boxes to fully exploit the inherent flexibility of the partitioned approach. Particular emphasis is set on component- based design to allow for simple future extensions and user friendliness to foster acceptance by FSI application developers. Computations of benchmark and application scenarios validate and show the potential of the implemented functionality.},

@article{Lee2011,
abstract = {This paper presents an analytical model and a geometric numerical integrator for a tethered spacecraft model that is composed of two rigid bodies connected by an elastic tether. This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},
