@article{Heywood1996,
abstract = {Fluid dynamical problems are often conceptualized in unbounded domains. However, most methods of numerical simulation then require a truncation of the conceptual domain to a bounded one, thereby introducing artificial boundaries. Here we analyse our experience in choosing artificial boundary conditions implicitly through the choice of variational formulations. We deal particularly with a class of problems that involve the prescription of pressure drops and/or net flux conditions.},
