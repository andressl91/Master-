\chapter{Conclusion and further research}
A monolithic fluid-structrue interaction solver have been developed using the arbitary Lagrangian Eulerian method, suitable for lamiar viscus flow and large structure deformation. The code has been verified by order of convergence test, and validated by the fluid-structure interaction benchmark in \cite{Hron2006}. A comparison of different mesh moving models have been conducted, with run-time optimizations using a newton solver. \\

Mesh motion models have proven to effect the physics of the fluid, due to different evolution of fluid mesh cells.


The physics of the fluid have proven to be effected by different mesh motion models,
